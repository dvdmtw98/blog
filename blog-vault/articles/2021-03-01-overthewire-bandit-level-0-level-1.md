> The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Commands you may need to solve this level

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
