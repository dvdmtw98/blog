## Level Goal

> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**

## Commands you may need to solve this level

> grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

```
> whatis grep

## Solution

View the contents of the current working directory

```
bandit7@bandit:~$ ls  
data.txt
```

Peek at the data that is present in the file. This can be achieved using the `head` command

```
bandit7@bandit:~$ head -n 10 data.txt   
binning WnfnFPqkuhl2nwHBohzn2C4L5W0gwcLq  
abuts v8PAwDdkGDdp5NsJ7ZFM5A7TJ5MkYDbm

```

(The -n flag allows us to specify how many lines to print from the start of the file. We can use the `tail` command to look at the last n lines of a file)

We know the password is next to the word "millionth" in the file. We can look for this pattern by using the `grep` command

```
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth data.txt   
millionth cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV
```

We have found the password for the next level !!

Logout of the current session and use the password of user bandit8 to access the next level

```
