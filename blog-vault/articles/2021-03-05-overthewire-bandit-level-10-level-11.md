## Level Goal

> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which contains base64 encoded data

## Commands you may need to solve this level

> grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

```
> whatis grep  
grep (1)             - print lines that match patterns

> whatis sort  
sort (1)             - sort lines of text files

> whatis uniq  
uniq (1)             - report or omit repeated lines

> whatis strings  
strings (1)          - print the sequences of printable characters in files

> whatis base64  
base64 (1)           - base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output

> whatis tr  
tr (1)               - translate or delete characters

> whatis tar  
tar (1)              - an archiving utility

> whatis gzip  
gzip (1)             - compress or expand files

> whatis bzip2  
bzip2 (1)            - a block-sorting file compressor, v1.0.8

> whatis xxd  
xxd (1)              - make a hexdump or do the reverse.
```

**Note:** All commands don't have to be used to complete level

## Helpful Reading Material

[Base64 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

[Bash base64 encoding and decoding](https://linuxhint.com/bash_base64_encode_decode/)

## Solution

View the contents of the current working directory

```
bandit10@bandit:~$ ls  
data.txt
```

View the data that is present in the file

```
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt  
VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIElGdWt3S0dzRlc4TU9xM0lSRnFyeEUxaHhUTkViVVBSCg==
```

Looking at the content it looks like a string of random characters but from the question we know that the data is base64 encoded. We can decode this data using the `base64` command that is present on Unix systems. The `-d` flag is used to decode the data

_(For detailed information on base64 encoding refer to the attached article)_

```
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | base64 -d  
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
```

We have found the password for the next level !!

Logout of the current session and use the password of user bandit11 to access the next level

```
