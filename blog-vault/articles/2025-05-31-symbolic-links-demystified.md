A symbolic link (also called a symlink) is a file that points to another file or directory. Symlinks allow us to use the same data at multiple locations on the system without having to duplicate it.

A symbolic link is a filesystem object that contains the path to another filesystem object (file or directory). When a symlink is accessed, the OS transparently resolves the path and puts us at that location.
