## Solution

From the question, we understand that at this level we are going to be working with Git. Before we clone the repository let's make a folder in the `/tmp` directory as from some of the previous levels we know we only have proper permissions to save files in the `/tmp` folder.

```
bandit27@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/

bandit27@bandit:/tmp$ mkdir git_level27

bandit27@bandit:/tmp$ cd git_level27

bandit27@bandit:/tmp/git_level27$
```

Now that we have created our working directory let's clone the repository.

![Clone Git Repository](images/bandit-27-28/clone-git-repo.png)

The password for the repository is the same as bandit27

```
Password: 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
```

Now that we have the repository cloned to our machine. Let us see what files are present in the repository.

![View Repo Content|360](images/bandit-27-28/view-content.png)

We see that there is a file called "README" in the folder. Let us have a look at the contents of this file.

**Note:** The `.git` directory found in the repository is created by git that consists of files that are required for the proper functioning of the features that are provided by git.

```
bandit27@bandit:/tmp/git_level27/repo$ cat README   
The password to the next level is: 0ef186ac70e04ea33b4c1853d2526fa2
```

And there we go we have the password for the next level !!!

Logout of the current session and log in as bandit28 to start the next level
