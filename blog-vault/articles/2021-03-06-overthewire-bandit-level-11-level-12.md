## Solution

View the contents of the current working directory

```
bandit11@bandit:~$ ls  
data.txt
```

View the data that is present in the file

```
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt  
Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh
```

We know that the characters in the data are rotated by 13 characters. We can get the characters to their original order using the `tr` command. The `tr` command is used to translate/ transform data from one form to another.

_(Refer to the attached resources for more information on the tr command)_

```
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'  
The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
```

We have found the password for the next level !!

Logout of the current session and use the password of user bandit12 to access the next level
