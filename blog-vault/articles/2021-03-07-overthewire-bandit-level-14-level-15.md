## Solution

From the question, we know that there is a service that is running on port 30,000. We can try to connect to the service using Netcat

_(For the syntax of netcat and additional usage refer to the attached resources)_

**Note:** `nc` is an alias for `netcat` and can be used interchangeably

```
bandit14@bandit:~$ netcat localhost 30000  
Password  
Wrong! Please enter the correct current password
```

When we enter a random value we see that we get a message saying the password is incorrect

We know that the current level password is stored in `/etc/band_pass/bandit14` we can try to provide that as a value to the service and see if we get the password for the next level

```
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14  
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e

bandit14@bandit:~$ netcat localhost 30000  
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e  
Correct!

```

We have found the password for the next level !!!

Logout of the current session and login into the next level using the bandit15 password

```
> ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
