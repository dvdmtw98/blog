ls (1)          - list directory contents  

> whatis cd

[command line - How to access files/directories with spaces in the name? - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/516772/how-to-access-files-directories-with-spaces-in-the-name)

## Solution

View the files that are present in the current working directory using the `ls` command

```bash
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls  
spaces in this filename
```

View the content of the file named `spaces in this filename` using the `cat` command

**Note:** We command directly open this file as there are spaces in the filename. The spaces in the name can be escaped using `\`, another approach is to enclose the filename in `".."` (quotes)

**Note:** The name of any file on the system can be auto-completed using the `Tab` key.

```bash
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename  
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename"  
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

We have found the password for the next level. Logout of the current session and use the password of user bandit3 to access the next level

```bash
> ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
