## Level Goal

> The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don't. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

## Commands you may need to solve this level

> ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

```
> whatis ssh  
ssh (1)              - OpenSSH remote login client  

> whatis telnet  
telnet (1)           - user interface to the TELNET protocol  

> whatis nc      
nc (1)               - TCP/IP swiss army knife  

> whatis openssl  
openssl (1ssl)       - OpenSSL command line tool  

> whatis s_client  
s_client (1ssl)      - SSL/TLS client program  

> whatis nmap      
nmap (1)             - Network exploration tool and security/ port scanner
```

**Note:** Not all commands are required to complete the level

## Solution

We know there that the service that we need is running in the range of 31,000-32,000. We can find all services in that range using Nmap.

The -T4 flag is used to increase the speed of the scan while the -p flag is used to specify the ports and the -sV flag is used to identify the versions of the services.

_(For more information on the various flags provided by Nmap refer to the attached resources)_

```
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV -T4 -p 31000-32000 localhost

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-03-07 09:04 CET

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 89.88 seconds
```

From our scan results, we can see that multiple services are running in that range but if we look at the results more closely we see that on port 31790 there is a service that returns the message "Enter correct password". As we need to find a service to send passwords we can conclude that this is the service that we need.

We know that the service uses SSL encryption. So we need to use the `openssl` and `s_client` commands to connect to the port and pass the password of the current user

_(Refer to the previous level if not sure how to use these commands)_

We did not get any password but got an RSA Key that can be used with SSH to access the next level. We need to save the key in a file to be used with SSH. As we don't have permission in the current working directory to make a file. We create a folder in the `/tmp` directory and work from there.

```
bandit16@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/random_sshkey

bandit16@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/random_sshkey

bandit16@bandit:/tmp/random_sshkey$ touch private.key

bandit16@bandit:/tmp/random_sshkey$ vim private.key
```

**Note:** We can use any text editor to save the key in the file but here we are using the Vim editor

*   Once Vim opens Press "i" to enter insert mode
*   Then use Ctrl + Shift + V to paste the copied key

![SSH RSA Key|500](images/bandit-16-17/ssh-rsa-key.png)

*   Press the "Esc" key to return to normal mode
*   Then type `:wq` to save and exit the file

Change the permissions of the file so that other users cannot access the file

_(This step is required as when we try to use the key without changing the permission we are going to get an error preventing us from using the key)_

```
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/random_sshkey$ chmod 400 private.keybandit16@bandit:/tmp/random_sshkey$ ls -l  
total 4  
-r-------- 1 bandit16 root 1676 Mar  7 09:23 private.key
```

Now we can use the key file with the `ssh` command to access the next level

```
bandit16@bandit:/tmp/random_sshkey$ ssh -i private.key 
bandit17@localhost
```

_(If asked to accept a fingerprint enter "yes")_

Welcome to OverTheWire!
.
.
.
bandit17@bandit:~$
```

We have gained access to the next level

Let us capture the password of the current level so we can log in later if required

```
bandit17@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17  
xLYVMN9WE5zQ5vHacb0sZEVqbrp7nBTn
```

We have found the password for the current level !!!

Logout of the current session (bandit17) and the previous session (bandit16) and use the password of bandit17 to access the next level

```
